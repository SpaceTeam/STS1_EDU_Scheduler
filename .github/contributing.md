# Contributing Guidelines

First of all, thanks for contributing to the project. Here is some quick help.

## What should this thing do?
All of what is coded here, should be based on the Preliminary Design Document (also called EDU PDD). You can find it here https://www.overleaf.com/project/628ce894934b28e99889f531

Ask David Wagner if you need access to the document.

## What needs to be done?
Check the issue list for open tasks. It is not an exhaustive list, but should always be populated. If you are new to the team or Rust, look out for the ones tagged with "good first issue".

## How do I add my changes?
1. Choose an issue you want to work on
2. Assign yourself to it (Assignee thingy on the right)
3. Create a branch and start commiting
4. Format your code (`cargo fmt --all`) and test (`cargo test --features mock`)
5. Create a Pull Request on Github
6. Done!
